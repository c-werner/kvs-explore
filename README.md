# kvs-explore
Simple KVS HTTP Service implemented in a few languages to explore how it feels to write minimal microservices in them.

I wouldn't suggest using these as a model for anything, the APIs and program structure are purely geared towards giving me an opportunity to explore the languages.

## TODO
- [ ] Tests
- [ ] The Rust version doesn't return status codes
- [ ] More languages
- [ ] Client Library
